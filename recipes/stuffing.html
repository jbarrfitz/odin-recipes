    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Chop bread into cubes, approx 1/2 to 1 inch thick, placing in large
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Butter a casserole dish (3-4 quarts).</li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tbsp butter in a large skillet and brown the sausage until it
        loses most of its pink but do not fully cook.
      </li>
      <li>Add sausage and drippings to the bowl containing the bread.</li>
      <li>Melt 2 tbsp butter in the skillet.</li>
      <li>
        Add the onions, apple, celery, and 1 tsp salt to the skillet and cook
        until veggies soften, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the broth, and bring to a boil. Allow to boil for about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mixture over the break and sausage and toss until evenly
        moistened.
      </li>
      <li>Mix in the eggs and walnuts.</li>
      <li>Loosely pack the mixture into the casserole dish.</li>
      <li>
        Cook uncovered in oven approximately 35 to 40 minutes, until a crust is
        formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle melted butter (about 2 tbsp) over the top and cook another 20
        minutes.
      </li>
